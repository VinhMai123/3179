            eight of them belong to <span class="bi">America </span> and two belong to the <span class="bi">United Kingdom </span>. <span class="Harvard1">Harvard Univerisity </span> was established in 1636 and is known as the oldest

          <h2>National Rank vs. Global Rank of the top 20 Ranked Univerisities</h2>
          <p class ="content">The scatterplot on the right compares the national and gloabl ranking of the <span class="bi">top 20</span> Universities in the world.
            <span class="Harvard2">Harvard Univerisity </span> remains at the top both nationally and globally. Many of these Univerisities have pretty consistant rankings. However,
          there are some Universities that rank much higher nationally than globally. One example we can see here is from the <span class="Tokyo1">Univerisity of Tokyo</span>. In <span class="bi">Japan</span>,
        it is the best ranked University. However, when compared globally, it <span class="bi">struggles to break the 10</span>, ranking at <span class="bi">13th in the world</span>. <span class="cam">University of Cambridge</span> is also number 1
      in the UK. However, its ranking falls short of America's top three Ivy League Schools.    </p>
